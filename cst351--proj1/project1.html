                <p>For project 1, i was tasked with creating a website that would showcase my creative process for each
                    project in my web design class.
                    <br><br>
                    I went about this, beginning with a brainstorm and concept map of things i could relate to myself.
                    <br><br>
                    in doing this i provided myself a clear understanding of what makes up me, and this gave me quite a
                    few
                    ideas on where to start with designs.

                <p>From the mindmap and brainstorm, I was able to come up with some ideas and inspirations I could
                    expand on.
                    <br><br>
                    Once a few sketches were drawn up, including themes related to sneakers, photography, the ocean and
                    memes, I began bringing these sketches to a digital medium. This became my first ever round of
                    basic digital mock-ups for my potential site.
                    <br><br>
                    Needless to say, this step in the process was essential in brining light to the things in my design
                    that were... shit.

                <p>After taking in some much needed feedback, I realized a lot of the flaws in my first mock-up came
                    from my navigation and focus.
                    <br><br>
                    With this new knowledge I redesigned my mock-up to reflect the suggested changes.
                    <br><br>
                    This design step was where I was really able to see a change in the design of my site and where I
                    was going to take it.

                <p>Here is where my key design elements became more defined and I was able to really dig down and focus
                    on what the site needed. This had to do with the focus of the site, it's purpose, and how I could
                    shape my design around this.
                    <br><br>
                    To resolve these dependencies, I did a complete overhaul on my 'projects' pages and how those would
                    be represented.
                    <br><br>
                    In rebuilding my design, yet agian, I was able to really able to show myself that I could design
                    and do it with a purpose.

                <p>Here I was able to relfect and see the flaws in my intital designs and how they were addressed. This
                    was my time to look back at my design steps and see what I could do better and/or revise.
                    <br><br>
                    In reflecting on my work, I saw that something I never put enough thought into was how I would
                    actually show content!!!! To fix this, I went about by redesigning my projects page to show
                    content.
                    <br><br>
                    If it were not for this design step, I more than likely would've forgotten I was missing a display
                    for these projects. So this was a key step in the development of my site.

                <p>The implementation of my design was suprisingly difficcult. Although a simple and straight forward
                    design, because of it's unorthodox design/architecture, it was far from simple to implement.
                    <br><br>
                    In the process of creating this site, I began by creating the site by hand on a local server. Due
                    to Wordpress's injection of code and styles, the migration of my
                    site from a local server to their CMS was quite daunting. To solve this issue I pushed my changes
                    to a Heroku server and left it at that.
                    <br><br>
                    Reflecting on this decision to step away from Wordpress, I would not change it going forward with
                    design and development. For this project and my needs it was not suitable, and for sites requiring
                    a higher level of customization, built upon a premade CMS, I'd recommend <a style="font-size: inherit;"
                        href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>.

                <p>Here we see the final design in it's implementation.
                    <br><br>
                    For this site, I hosted it on a presonal Heroku server, in order to have full control of it's
                    styling, without the limits of Wordpress. Though, I do still have a version of the site available
                    on Wordpress.
                    <br><br>
                    A long time coming, I am proud of this site. It taught me a lot about design, through trial and
                    error, and gave me a clear understanding of where I am in design along with where I can look to
                    grow.
