                <p style="width: 60%; font-size: 2vw;">For project 2, our group selected client was Old Town Monterey.
                    <br><br>
                    For this project we began with simply researching the client and their competitors. This gave us a
                    clearer understanding of the client and their clientel.

                    The next step in our process was research, and then development.
                    <br><br>
                    We began by researching the client. In our case the client was a 'district' in Monetery, and one
                    filled with a rich history. Seeing the branding a presentation of local competitors as well gave us
                    a great idea as to what we'd like to avoid. This was especially useful in the development of color,
                    layout, branding, and site architecture.

                <p>The first step in our design process is to brainstorm.
                    <br><br>
                    After doing so much research, we ended up with a report detailing all that was researched and our
                    findings. Using this new knowledge with our collective creativity, we each began designing logos,
                    layouts, and color palettes we felt had potentional to contribute to the project.
                    <br><br>
                    This was an essential step, as it was our first time collectively deciding on design choices for
                    our client.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once some basics things like color, information architecture, and logo choices were decided, we
                    could begin layout development.
                    <br><br>
                    In doing this, I branched out from some of my basic sketches into sketches that were much more
                    detailed with footnotes to better help the client convey what it was I was designing and how it
                    would potentially interact.
                    <br><br>
                    I greatly appreciated this step, as it was key point in my personal development. I was getting more
                    used to sketching these mock-ups and I became much more devoted to my work, putting in the extra
                    effort to really get my designs accross.

                    Receiving feedback from my team, I gained some direction on the development of my design.
                    <br><br>
                    I proceeded to implement more of what my team suggested. This included the implementation of an
                    agreed upon color palette, logo, and basic design theme.
                    <br><br>
                    Through this process, our communication as a team grew. We were able to work more productively as a
                    team after this point, as we all had agreed upon the staples of our client site.

                    At this point, as a group we've decided on how most the site would incorporate specific design
                    elements. Next was to finalize.
                    <br><br>
                    We went about this by deciding on a final base design on which to use as a basic template. From
                    there, using similar spacing, layout design, and color usage, each team member was tasked with
                    creating a portion of the site.
                    <br><br>
                    This part of our design process was a great experience, and it really pushed us as a team to
                    communicate and cooperate more than before. It was a great experience to build off of.

                    This step represents our final checkpoint, prior to production and final development.
                    <br><br>
                    Reaching this point, it was important for us to double check all our essentials for each page, and
                    to make sure we were all on the same page prior to production.
                    <br><br>
                    Reflecting on what we'd created allowed me to clearly see where I fell within my group, in relation
                    to design. Also helping me to see, even more so, where I can grow.

                    Here we began production of the site, using Wordpress.

                    After organizing ourselves and distributing the work evenly, we began production. This process was
                    tediuos but possible. We were aided by a template and some plugins we had found.
                    <br><br>
                    This part of the process is where I felt most useful. I was able to help my teammates with the
                    development of the site utilizing some basic CSS.

                    Finally, our site was completely implemented.
                    <br><br>
                    Through our struggles with Wordpress, we were successful in somewhat accurately recreating our
                    design. Though, where it failed, our migration from the dev to live server somehow lost a bit of
                    site information.
