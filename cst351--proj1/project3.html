                    For project 3, we were tasked with creating a design metaphor.
                    <br><br>
                    To understand what it was I would be designing, I looked through past examples.

                    The challenge of this project was to find a way to create a design referencing color indirectly.
                    <br><br>
                    To do this, we began by brainstorming and developing mindmaps of things we felt related to the idea
                    of color(s).
                    <br><br>
                    I personally felt that this was a fun, but confusing exercise. Though it was straight forward, the
                    results were interesting.

                    After deciding on a few ideas we began design.
                    <br><br>
                    Here, I began designing prototype websites and mock-ups based on the ideas I'd come up with in the
                    Ideation stage.
                    <br><br>
                    Of all the projects I was tasked with this semster, this one was the most enjoyable and where I
                    felt I could see my growth the most. My designs here came most from a place of passion as I was
                    able to design something from my heart with very minimal constraints.

                    After designing some mock-ups, my next step was to begin development of them using a digital tool.
                    <br><br>
                    Utilizing Adobe Illustrator, I began breathing life into my favorite design. Using sneakers as my
                    inspiration, I was able to create a nire detailed representation of my sketches.
                    <br><br>
                    in doing this i provided myself a clear understanding of what makes up me, and this gave me quite a
                    few
                    ideas on where to start with designs.
                </p>

                    The final step in this project was showing our final designs.
                    <br><br>
                    Here I added the finishing touches to my designs and finalized mock-ups showcasing design features,
                    flow of content, and my design metaphor of relating sneakers, color, and music.
                    <br><br>
                    I am very proud of what I was able to create as a result of this project. I felt that this project
                    was very much key in my development as a designer, and looking back at my past designs leading up
                    to this, I can clearly see my growth.
